            <h1>About iDAI.chronontology</h1>

            <p>
                iDAI.chronontology (short form: chronOntology) is a web service that connects chronological terms with data links. Similarly to the iDAI.gazetteter, it serves as a standard data vocabulary for other information systems of the DAI, and links those with other global time gazetteer systems. In addition, anyone can refer to the data in chronOntology and one could also add additional project-specific or research-specific data on request. ChronOntology is an internet research tool for the Archaeology and Altertumswissenschaft, it is part of the iDAI.welt and is the periods gazetteer of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI).
            </p>
            <p>
                The chronOntology project was funded from 2015 to 2017 by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The long-term availability of the data is guaranteed by the DAI within the scope of the iDAI.welt.
